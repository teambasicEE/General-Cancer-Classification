# Introduction
- general cancer classification Using deep learning, especially CNNs
- previous researches (pan-cancer classification) usually based on gene expressions and its characteristics
- or CNNs used for only single organ's cancer classification (Ex. breast, colon, prostate, gastric ...)
- We aim to make 'General' model to cancer classification
- Get cell images, for any organs and classify its cancer grade.

# Progress
1. Baseline Models
   - make single-organ cancer classification model for colon, prostate, gastric cancer classification
2. Integrated Models
   - Just use one model for all datas, learn and infer. Compare to single organ models its performance. 
3. Learning strategy(domain adaptation, generalization)
   - Use ensembles, DANN, MixStyle, etc..



# todo
- [ ]  dataloader for each organs
- [ ] classification model for each organ
- [ ] dataloader for integrated model
- [ ] classification for integrated model(careful of how using data)
- [ ] apply DANN
- [ ] apply MixStyle
